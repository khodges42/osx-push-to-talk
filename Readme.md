# OSX PushToTalk

OSX PushToTalk mutes and unmutes the microphone via keypress.

When the Application starts, it will add a status icon. Hold the **Right option** key to talk, and release to mute

The icon indicator will be translucent if the microphone is muted.

Application Installer (dmg) can be downloaded in the [Release](https://github.com/yulrizka/osx-push-to-talk/releases) Section
